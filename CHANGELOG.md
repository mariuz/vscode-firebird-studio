# Change Log

All notable changes to the "vscode-firebird-studio" extension will be documented in this file.

## 0.1.13 - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- Fixed "SQL error code = -204, Data type unknown, Implementation limit exceeded, COLUMN" when editing a stored procedure, trigger, or view's source. These fetch their `RDB$*_SOURCE` BLOB via `CAST(... AS VARCHAR(32000))` with no explicit character set; since connections default to UTF8 (up to 4 bytes/char), that cast needed up to 128000 bytes — well past Firebird's 32767-byte column limit — and always failed. Now casts to an explicit `CHARACTER SET UTF8` sized to fit (8191 chars), and warns in the opened scaffold if a very large body still hits that limit.

## 0.1.12 - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- Fixed "Your user name and password are not defined" when expanding a table, view, or stored procedure in the Explorer view, or editing a view/procedure/trigger's source. `NodeDatabase` resolved the saved connection's password from SecretStorage before listing its own children, but handed the *unresolved* connection down to the `NodeTable`/`NodeView`/`NodeProcedure` objects it created; those then connected directly without resolving it themselves. Every direct-connect call site now resolves the password first via a shared `Driver.resolvePassword()` helper.

## 0.1.11 - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Session query history now automatically logs *every* query run through the extension — predefined tree actions (Select All Records, Show Table Info, Drop Table/View/Procedure/Trigger/Generator/Domain, Table Designer DDL, etc.), not just the main "Run Query" editor command
- Each history entry now records which connection it ran against; re-running a history entry (**History → Run**) replays it against that original connection instead of whatever happens to be active, falling back to the active connection with a notice if the original was removed
- History entries display their connection in the tree and tooltip

### Changed

- Deduplicated the "extract database filename from a connection path" logic that had been copy-pasted across `Global`, the connection picker, and the database tree node into a single shared helper

## 0.1.10 - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Batch execution: running a query now correctly handles multiple `;`-separated statements in a single document, including `CREATE`/`ALTER PROCEDURE`, `TRIGGER`, `FUNCTION`, and `EXECUTE BLOCK` bodies (with or without the isql `SET TERM ^ ;` convention used by this extension's own snippets) as a single atomic statement instead of splitting on their internal semicolons

### Fixed

- Upgraded TypeScript to 6.0.3 and fixed the resulting strict-mode findings across the codebase
- Corrected `wireCrypt` connection option translation for the non-native driver, which previously could hang the connection instead of erroring
- Fixed several GitHub Actions CI issues (unit tests running the wrong test tier, workflows resolving an unpinned global TypeScript instead of the project's version)

## 0.1.9 - 2026-04-07

### Changed

- Renamed extension to **Firebird Studio for VS Code** (`vscode-firebird-studio`)
- Updated publisher to `mariuz`, repository and bug tracker URLs to `github.com/mariuz/vscode-firebird-studio`
