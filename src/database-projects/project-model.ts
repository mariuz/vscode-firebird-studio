 * of this file's domains/exceptions/roles/users work existed): confirmed directly against a live

 * defined" the moment a trigger body calls `GEN_ID(some_generator, 1)` (a common pattern for an
 * auto-incrementing key, e.g. this exact case) and that generator's own CREATE SEQUENCE hasn't run
 * yet — a table column DEFAULT or a procedure body can reference a generator the same way. This
 * was invisible before Publish/migrate (Phase 3) started *executing* generated scripts instead of
 * only opening them for review, the same way the four bugs documented in
 * docs/roadmap/database-projects.md's "Four real bugs found and fixed" section were.
 *
 * Exceptions specifically must come before procedures/triggers, not just after: confirmed
 * directly against a live server that CREATE PROCEDURE/TRIGGER fails outright ("exception ... not
 * defined") if any exception it raises via an `EXCEPTION name;` statement doesn't already exist —
 * this isn't just a style preference like most of the rest of this ordering. Domains have no such
 * hard requirement here (getSchemaColumnsQuery()'s columns already resolve to a domain's
 * *underlying* base type rather than referencing the domain by name, so a generated CREATE TABLE
 * never actually depends on a domain existing first) but are still placed early as the
 * conventional "define your types before your tables" order. Roles/users have no dependency on or
 * from anything else here, so they're placed last as the least schema-central objects.
