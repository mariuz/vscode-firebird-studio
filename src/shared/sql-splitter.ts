/**
 * Splits a SQL document into individual statements for batch execution.
 *
 * Handles:
 *  - single-quoted string literals (including escaped quotes '')
 *  - line comments (--)
 *  - block comments (slash-star ... star-slash)
 *  - the semicolon statement terminator
 *  - `SET TERM <token> ;` — Firebird isql's terminator-switch directive. The
 *    extension's own snippets (CREATE PROCEDURE/TRIGGER, etc.) wrap PSQL
 *    bodies in `SET TERM ^ ; ... END^ SET TERM ; ^` so that the semicolons
 *    inside the body aren't treated as statement boundaries. SET TERM lines
 *    are consumed to switch the active terminator and are never themselves
 *    emitted as statements (they aren't valid DSQL, only an isql directive).
 *  - PSQL blocks that *don't* use SET TERM: BEGIN...END and CASE...END are
 *    tracked as a nesting depth so a bare `CREATE PROCEDURE ... AS BEGIN
 *    ...; ...; END;` (no SET TERM) is still treated as one statement. A
 *    CREATE/ALTER PROCEDURE/TRIGGER/FUNCTION/PACKAGE BODY or EXECUTE BLOCK
 *    header additionally suppresses splitting until its first BEGIN, so a
 *    `DECLARE VARIABLE ...;` declaration section ahead of BEGIN isn't cut
 *    off (this only matters for the no-SET-TERM fallback; SET TERM already
 *    protects the whole statement regardless of what's in it).
 *
 * Empty / whitespace-only *and* comment-only statements are filtered out — a chunk that's nothing
 * but `-- ...` text (e.g. Database Projects' buildUserCreateDDL() emits a CREATE USER commented
 * out entirely, since a password can't be extracted/recreated) has no actual SQL for the server to
 * run; confirmed directly against a live server that sending one through anyway fails with
 * "Dynamic SQL Error ... Unexpected end of command" rather than silently succeeding as a no-op.

 * check missed this whenever a comment came first (e.g. a "-- New/changed procedures" note ahead
 * of a `CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE ... BEGIN ... END` block with no SET TERM), since a comment's
 * own text is non-blank and had already been appended into `current` verbatim — the PSQL-header
 * case would then never trigger, and the procedure body's internal `;` got mistaken for the

 * run-statement-under-cursor.md) to find which statement a cursor offset falls inside; a cursor
 * sitting in pure inter-statement whitespace falls outside every returned range on purpose (a
 * leading comment immediately before a statement is still part of that statement's range, exactly
