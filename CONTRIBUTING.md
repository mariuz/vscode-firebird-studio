## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and considerate in all interactions. We follow the standard open-source community norms: be welcoming, constructive, and professional.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 16 or later
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) 8 or later
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 1.32 or later
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A running [Firebird](https://firebirdsql.org/) instance (optional, for integration testing)

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/vscode-firebird-studio.git
   cd vscode-firebird-studio
   ```

3. Add the upstream remote so you can pull in future changes:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/mariuz/vscode-firebird-studio.git
   ```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Build and Run

The project uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) for fast bundling.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run compile` | Build the extension (output to `out/`) |
| `npm run watch` | Rebuild on every file change |
| `npm run tsc-compile` | Type-check with TypeScript (reference only — known pre-existing errors) |

To run the extension inside a VS Code Extension Development Host:

1. Open the repository folder in VS Code.
2. Press `F5` (or **Run → Start Debugging**).
3. A new VS Code window opens with the extension loaded.

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. Create a feature branch from `master`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```

2. Make your changes, keeping commits small and focused.
3. Build and verify locally (`npm run compile`, then `F5` in VS Code).
4. Push your branch and open a Pull Request.

### Coding Style

- **TypeScript** is used throughout. Avoid `any` where possible — prefer explicit types.
- Formatting is enforced by **ESLint** (`.eslintrc.js`). Run the linter before committing:

  ```bash
  npx eslint src --ext .ts
  ```

- Prefer `const` over `let`; avoid `var`.
- Use `async/await` rather than raw `Promise` chains.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.

### Commit Messages

Use the conventional commit format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

[optional body]
[optional footer]
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

**Examples:**

```
feat(completion): add context-aware JOIN completion
fix(tree): prevent crash when database is unreachable
docs(readme): add connection setup screenshot
chore(deps): upgrade esbuild to 0.19
```

---

## Testing

The project uses VS Code's built-in Mocha test runner. Tests are in `src/test/`.

```bash
# Run extension tests (requires VS Code)
npm run test
```

When adding new features, check whether existing tests cover the affected code paths and add tests if they don't.

---

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with upstream `master`:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/master
   ```

2. Push to your fork and open a PR against `mariuz/vscode-firebird-studio:master`.
3. Fill in the PR template (what changed and why).
4. A maintainer will review your PR. Please respond to feedback promptly.

**PR checklist:**

- [ ] `npm run compile` succeeds with no new errors.
- [ ] ESLint passes (`npx eslint src --ext .ts`).
- [ ] New or changed behaviour is covered by tests (where applicable).
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` has an entry for user-facing changes.
- [ ] Documentation in `README.md` or `docs/` is updated if needed.

---

## Reporting Bugs

Use the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/mariuz/vscode-firebird-studio/issues) and choose the **Bug report** template. Please include:

- OS and VS Code version
- Firebird server version
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behaviour
- Extension logs (open via **Firebird: Show Extension Logs** from the Command Palette)

---

## Requesting Features

Open an issue using the **Feature request** template. Check the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) first to see if the feature is already planned.
